# Tastytrade Enhancement Platform - System Architecture

## Overview

The Tastytrade Enhancement Platform is a comprehensive microservices-based trading application built with Spring Boot 3.2 and Java 21. It provides real-time options delta monitoring, advanced Greeks calculations, and multi-channel notifications for enhanced trading functionality.

## Architecture Principles

- **Microservices Architecture**: Loosely coupled services with clear boundaries
- **Event-Driven Design**: Asynchronous communication using RabbitMQ
- **Reactive Programming**: Spring WebFlux for high-throughput data streaming
- **Cloud-Native**: Kubernetes-ready with 12-factor app principles
- **Security-First**: JWT authentication, audit logging, and digital signatures
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with load balancing and caching
